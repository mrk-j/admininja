Welcome to admininja
===

I use `admininja` as my sideproject to learn more about Laravel 5 and package development. You are always welcome to contribute to my journey. Feel free to point out mistakes or ask questions.

Work in progress
===

Currently the repository is pretty empty, I will start developing soon!

What will `admininja` become?
===

* Easy to integrate
* Provide an easy CRUD interface for your existing models and relations
* Looks based on Twitter Bootstrap
* Much more!
